# Random thoughts
I think we need to make 1 single DO much more useful. Switching more DO's together that have no utility is not the way to go.

- A console only. Pretend it's a terminal / file system. 
> Kind of likd this.. type 'help' then it can tell you what it's capable of.

The key insight here is making each DO not just a data container, but a complete system with its own rules, behaviors, and capabilities. It's not about connecting simple DOs, but rather creating powerful, self-contained computing environments that can optionally interact with others.

These are systems that would be uniquely suited to living at the edge, taking advantage of:
- Persistence across requests
- WebSocket capabilities
- Edge computing location
- Isolated state management
- Real-time communication

Each of these could be interacted with through a terminal-like interface as you suggested, with the 'help' command revealing a rich set of capabilities specific to that DO's purpose.

The power of these concepts comes from:
- Persistent state between requests
- Edge computing capabilities
- Isolated execution environment
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Hierarchical organization

Each concept pushes the boundaries of what's possible with DOs while maintaining practical applicability. They're not just data stores - they're complete computing environments with specific purposes.

Key Principles:
1. Each DO should be self-contained and useful in isolation
2. Communication between DOs should enhance functionality, not be required for basic operation
3. The edge location should provide meaningful advantages
4. State persistence should enable unique capabilities
5. Real-time interaction should be core to the design
